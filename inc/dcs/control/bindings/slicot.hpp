 * \brief Header for bindings to all SLICOT Fortran routines.
 *
 * The subroutine library SLICOT provides Fortran 77 implementations of
 * numerical algorithms for computations in systems and control theory. Based on
 * numerical linear algebra routines from BLAS and LAPACK libraries, SLICOT
 * provides methods for the design and analysis of control systems.
 *
 * The SLICOT library is Copyright 2002-2012 NICONET e.V.
 * For more information, see <a href="http://www.slicot.org>SLICOT web site</a>.
